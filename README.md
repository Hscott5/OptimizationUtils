# OptimizationUtils

This toolbox is designed to optimize arbitrary variables to maximize the responses of a population of neurons. This repository contains a gradient-boosted particle swarm and a genetic algorithm as well as functions to generate linear-nonlinear model neurons with poisson variability. The model neurons are assumed to be gaussian tuned for each of the variables, but variable independence can be manipulated.
